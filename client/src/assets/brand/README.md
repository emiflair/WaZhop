# WaZhop Brand Assets

This folder contains the primary WaZhop lettermark and guidance for using it across the app and marketing.

## Files

- `wazhop-icon.svg` — Primary lettermark. Green rounded square with a white, friendly “W”. Works on both light and dark backgrounds.

## Usage

- App header: use the lettermark followed by the text “aZhop” so it reads as “WaZhop”.
- Size: 24–40px height for navigation; keep the rounded corners visible.
- Clear space: leave at least 1× icon corner radius around the mark when possible.
- Backgrounds: icon is self-contained; no need to invert in dark mode.

## Colors

- Gradient: `#34D399` → `#10B981` → `#059669`
- Letter: white `#FFFFFF`

## PWA icons (optional)

Export PNGs from the SVG for PWA manifest (recommended: 192×192 and 512×512, both maskable). You can use a design tool or a Node script with `sharp` to rasterize the SVG.
