## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Cloudinary account

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure your environment variables
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables (Reference)

Configure these in the appropriate place:

- Backend (Railway or server/.env):
	- `MONGODB_URI` – MongoDB Atlas connection string
	- `JWT_SECRET` – secure random string
	- `APP_BASE_URL` – your frontend URL (e.g. https://wazhop.vercel.app)
	- `EMAIL_PROVIDER` = `brevo`
	- `BREVO_API_KEY`, `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`, `BREVO_SENDER_NAME`
	- `SMS_PROVIDER` (optional) + related SMS keys
	- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
	- `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

- Frontend (Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables):
	- `VITE_API_URL` – your backend API base, e.g. `https://<railway-domain>.up.railway.app/api`

Notes:
- Railway injects `PORT` for you in production.
- CORS is controlled via `APP_BASE_URL`. Set it to your Vercel domain so the browser can call the API.
- SPA routing on Vercel is enabled via `client/vercel.json` which rewrites all paths to `/index.html`.

### Subscription Tiers

- **Pro (₦9,000/month):** Up to 100 products, 2 shops, inventory management, custom colors, no branding, custom subdomain, advanced analytics
- **Premium (₦18,000/month):** Unlimited products, 3 shops, payment integration (Flutterwave/Paystack), custom domain, advanced analytics, priority support

### Downgrades and Expiry Behavior

- User‑initiated downgrade to Free (destructive): Requires explicit confirmation in the dashboard. When confirmed, the system prunes data to meet Free limits (keeps oldest shop, limits products to Free cap, clears stored images where applicable) and enforces WaZhop branding/watermark.
- Automatic downgrade on plan expiry (non‑destructive): If a paid plan expires and auto‑renew is off, the account is moved to Free without deleting data. Limits are enforced non‑destructively by deactivating extra shops and enabling branding/watermark. Requests during expiry may respond with HTTP 402 (Payment Required) to prompt renewal.

Notes:
- The client may handle HTTP 402 globally by showing a friendly message and redirecting users to the Subscription page to renew.
- Exact limits are enforced server‑side. See server utils and controllers for details.
