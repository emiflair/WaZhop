## Note:
**You DON'T need to create payment links manually anymore!** 

The full API integration we just completed is better because:
- ✅ Automatic payment verification
- ✅ Instant plan upgrades after payment
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Coupon code support
- ✅ Proper security and validation

Payment links are only useful if you want to accept payments outside your platform (e.g., via direct links shared on social media).
